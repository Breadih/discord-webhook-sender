# Discord Webhook Sender

## Overview

The **Discord Webhook Sender** is a simple but powerful tool that allows
you to send messages to Discord channels using webhooks.\
It is designed for developers, community managers, or automation
enthusiasts who want to send custom notifications, alerts, or messages
directly from their apps, scripts, or servers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How It Works

Discord webhooks provide a way to send messages into channels without a
full bot.\
This tool simply formats your messages and sends them to the provided
webhook URL.

### Typical Use Cases

-   Sending **alerts** from a server, application, or CI/CD pipeline.
-   Notifying your Discord community about **new content** (e.g., new
    blog posts, new commits, releases).
-   Creating **custom logging systems** that forward messages into a
    private Discord channel.
-   Automating **simple interactions** without needing a bot.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key Features

-   âœ… **Simple Setup** -- Just paste your webhook URL and message.
-   âœ… **Customizable Messages** -- Support for text, embeds, and
    mentions.
-   âœ… **Lightweight** -- No need for Discord bot tokens or OAuth.
-   âœ… **Fast** -- Near real-time message delivery.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Installation & Usage

### 1. Create a Discord Webhook

1.  Go to your Discord server.
2.  Open **Server Settings \> Integrations \> Webhooks**.
3.  Create a new webhook, choose the channel, and copy the **Webhook
    URL**.

### 2. Run the Tool

Depending on your implementation:

``` bash
# Example if it's a CLI tool
discord-webhook-sender --url https://discord.com/api/webhooks/... --message "Hello World!"
```

Or, if you're running it as a script, configure the `WEBHOOK_URL` and
`MESSAGE` variables inside the script, then execute.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Suggested Additional Features

Here are some features you could add to make this tool more powerful and
flexible:

-   **Multiple Webhooks Support** -- Send messages to multiple
    servers/channels at once.
-   **Embeds Builder** -- Allow users to send rich embeds (title,
    description, fields, color).
-   **File Attachments** -- Upload and send files/images along with
    messages.
-   **Rate Limit Handling** -- Queue messages if rate-limited by
    Discord.
-   **Templates & Presets** -- Predefined message formats for common use
    cases (alerts, announcements, logs).
-   **Interactive CLI/GUI** -- User-friendly interface for quickly
    sending messages.
-   **Logging & History** -- Keep a history of messages sent for
    auditing/debugging.
-   **Schedule Messages** -- Option to send messages at specific times
    or intervals.
-   **Environment Variables Support** -- Store webhook URLs securely
    without hardcoding.
-   **Webhook Health Check** -- Test if a webhook is still valid before
    sending.

## Example Output

Sending a message with an embed:

``` jsonc
{
  "content": "ðŸš€ Deployment Successful!",
  "embeds": [
    {
      "title": "New Deployment",
      "description": "Version 2.1.0 has been deployed successfully.",
      "color": 3066993
    }
  ]
}
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Best Practices

-   ðŸ”‘ **Keep Webhook URLs Secret** -- Anyone with the URL can send
    messages.
-   âš¡ **Handle Rate Limits** -- Avoid spamming Discord servers.
-   ðŸŽ¨ **Use Embeds for Formatting** -- They look cleaner and more
    professional.
-   ðŸ”„ **Rotate Webhooks If Leaked** -- If a webhook URL leaks,
    regenerate it in Discord.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conclusion

This tool is a great lightweight alternative to a full Discord bot for
quick automations, notifications, and integrations.\
With some of the suggested features, it could become a versatile
developer utility for anyone managing Discord communities.
